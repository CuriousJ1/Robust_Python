Subtyped relationships are a very powerful concept in programming. You can use them to extend existing functionality without modifying it. However, inheritance is often overused, or used improperly. Subtypes should only be used if they are directly substitutable for their supertype. If this isn’t the case, reach for composition instead.
Special care should be taken when introducing supertypes or subtypes. It may not be easy for developers to know of all the subtypes associated with a single supertype; some subtypes may even live in other codebases. Supertypes and subtypes are very closely coupled, so be cautious whenever you make changes. With the proper dili‐ gence, you can reap all the benefits of subtyping without introducing a slew of headaches.
In the next chapter, I’m going to focus on a specific application of subtyping known as protocols. These are the missing link between the typechecker and duck typing. Protocols bridge the gap in an important way: they help your typechecker catch some of the errors introduced in a supertype/subtype relationship. Any time you catch more errors, especially through a typechecker, you are contributing to the robustness of your codebase.
